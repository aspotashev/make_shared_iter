KNOWN ISSUES:
* [WONTFIX] Doesn't work when `each_number' handles the value returned by the block, e.g.:
      def each_block
        (1..5).each do |x|
          break if (yield x).nil?
        end
      end
  In this case you shouldn't use make_shared_iterator.

* [FIXED] `make_shared_iterator' "breaks" your class: it spoils the iterating
  method (like `each_number') you give to it. You can't use
  `make_shared_iterator' again with the same iterating method.
